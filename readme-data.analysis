This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a Superstore to identify key performance indicators, understand customer behavior, and discover areas for improvement. By visualizing various aspects of the data, we aim to provide actionable insights for business strategy.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on the `Sample - Superstore[1].csv` dataset. This dataset contains 9994 rows and 21 columns, encompassing detailed information about orders, customers, products, and geographical locations.

**Key Columns:**

  - `Row ID`
  - `Order ID`
  - `Order Date`
  - `Ship Date`
  - `Ship Mode`
  - `Customer ID`
  - `Customer Name`
  - `Segment`
  - `Country`
  - `City`
  - `State`
  - `Postal Code`
  - `Region`
  - `Product ID`
  - `Category`
  - `Sub-Category`
  - `Product Name`
  - `Sales`
  - `Quantity`
  - `Discount`
  - `Profit`

## Installation

To run this analysis locally, you'll need Python and the following libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Place the dataset:** Ensure the `Sample - Superstore[1].csv` file is located in the root directory of the cloned repository, or update the path in the script.
3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python your_analysis_script_name.py
    ```
    (Replace `your_analysis_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script containing the analysis code.)

## Analysis Highlights

The initial data exploration revealed the following:

  - **Data Dimensions:** The dataset comprises 9994 entries and 21 columns.
  - **Missing Values:** No null values were found across any columns.
  - **Data Types:** A mix of `int64`, `object`, and `float64` types. `Order Date` and `Ship Date` were initially objects and converted to datetime for time-series analysis.
  - **Numerical Statistics:**
      - **Quantity:** Mean of 3.79, ranging from 1 to 14.
      - **Sales:** Mean of 229.86, ranging from 0.44 to 22638.48.
      - **Profit:** Mean of 28.66, with a significant range from -6599.98 (outliers) to 8399.98 (outliers).
      - **Discount:** Mean of 0.15, ranging from 0.00 to 0.80.
  - **Geographical Distribution:**
      - All data pertains to the **United States**.
      - **Regions:** West (32.0%), East (28.5%), Central (23.2%), South (16.2%).
      - **Cities:** "New York City" has the highest number of entries (915), while "Yuma" and "Aberdeen" represent the max and min alphabetically.
  - **Product Categories:**
      - Office Supplies: 6026 entries
      - Furniture: 2121 entries
      - Technology: 1847 entries
  - **Overall Financials:**
      - Total Discount: \~1561
      - Total Profit: \~286,397

## Visualizations

The analysis includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings:

  - **Sales vs. Discount (Average Value):** Compares the average sales and average discount.
  - **Sales vs. Quantity (Average Value):** Shows the relationship between average sales and average quantity.
  - **Quantity vs. Profit (Average Value):** Highlights the average quantity against average profit.
  - **Discount vs. Profit (Average Value):** Compares average discount to average profit.
  - **Distribution of Sales by Region (Pie Chart):** Visualizes the proportion of sales from each region.
  - **Count of Orders by Region (Bar Plot):** Displays the number of orders in each region.
  - **Profit by State (Categorical Plot):** Explores profit distribution across different states (Note: Due to the high number of states, this plot might be dense).
  - **Count of Orders by Category (Bar Plot):** Shows the distribution of orders across product categories.
  - **Sales vs. Profit (Scatter Plot):** Illustrates the correlation between sales and profit.
  - **Daily Sales Trend (Line Plot):** Visualizes the total sales over time, showing a significant boost in 2014 and a slower year in 2018.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, here are the key findings:

  - **Outliers in Profit:** There are significant outliers in both positive and negative profit values, suggesting some highly profitable and highly unprofitable transactions.
  - **Regional Contribution:** The West and East regions contribute the most to the sales volume.
  - **Category Dominance:** "Office Supplies" is the most frequently purchased category.
  - **Sales and Profit Relationship:** The scatter plot of Sales vs. Profit indicates a general positive correlation, but also highlights instances of high sales with low or negative profit, likely due to high discounts.
  - **Temporal Trends:** The daily sales trend shows fluctuations, with 2014 experiencing a notable surge in sales, while 2018 appears to be a slower year.
  - **Quantity vs. Profit Discrepancy:** There is a noticeable difference between the average quantity and average profit, suggesting that higher quantities don't always translate directly to higher profits.

This analysis provides a foundational understanding of the Superstore's performance. Further investigation into specific product sub-categories, customer segments, and the impact of discounts on profitability could yield even deeper insights.

# Test Match Cricket Batting Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`test_match_datacleaning.ipynb`) that demonstrates data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering on a dataset of Test Match cricket batting statistics.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to clean and prepare a raw dataset of Test Match batting records for potential future analysis or modeling. The notebook walks through various data manipulation techniques using the `pandas` library in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is an Excel file named `test.match.data.xlsx`, which contains batting statistics for various Test Match cricketers.

## Key Steps Performed

The `test_match_datacleaning.ipynb` notebook covers the following data processing steps:

1.  **Importing Libraries and Data:**

      * Imported essential Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`.
      * Loaded the `test.match.data.xlsx` file into a pandas DataFrame.

2.  **Initial Data Inspection and Null Value Check:**

      * Examined the first and last few rows of the DataFrame.
      * Calculated the sum of null values for each column to identify missing data.

3.  **Renaming Columns:**

      * Renamed columns for better readability and consistency:
          * `NO` to `Not_Out`
          * `HS` to `highest_score`
          * `BF` to `Ball_Faced`
          * `SR` to `Strike_Rate`
          * `Span` to `year_period`

4.  **Handling Missing Values:**

      * Filled remaining null values in `Not_Out`, `Ball_Faced`, and `Strike_Rate` columns using appropriate `fillna` methods (forward fill and backward fill).

5.  **Duplicate Detection and Removal:**

      * Checked for duplicate rows in the dataset.
      * Removed any identified duplicate rows to ensure data uniqueness.

6.  **Feature Engineering - Splitting Player Information:**

      * Extracted `Player_Name` and `Country` into separate columns from the `Player` column using string manipulation and regular expressions.
      * Cleaned up `Player_Name` by removing leading/trailing spaces.

7.  **Feature Engineering - Creating Binary Indicator:**

      * Created a new column `Not_Out_Status` which is `1` if a player was not out in any innings (i.e., `Not_Out` \> 0), and `0` otherwise.

8.  **Feature Engineering - Splitting Year Period:**

      * Divided the `year_period` column into `start_year` and `end_year` columns to represent the player's career span.

9.  **Correcting Data Types:**

      * Converted relevant columns to their appropriate data types (e.g., `highest_score`, `Ball_Faced`, `start_year`, `end_year` to integer/numeric types).
      * Handled special characters (`*`, `+`, `-`) in numeric columns (`highest_score`, `Ball_Faced`) before type conversion.

10. **Column Dropping:**

      * Removed the original `Player` and `year_period` columns after extracting necessary information into new columns.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BilawalBaloch/Projects.git
    cd Projects
    ```
2.  **Place the dataset:**
      * Ensure the `test.match.data.xlsx` file is in the same directory as the `test_match_datacleaning.ipynb` notebook.
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
    ```
4.  **Run the notebook:**
      * Open `test_match_datacleaning.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run all cells.

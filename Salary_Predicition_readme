# 📊 Salary Prediction Project

A machine learning project that predicts salary based on years of experience using linear regression.

## 📁 Dataset Information

**Source:** Kaggle - "Salary CSV" dataset  
**Size:** 35 rows × 2 columns  
**Features:**
- `YearsExperience` (float64): Number of years of work experience (1.1 to 13.5 years)
- `Salary` (int64): Corresponding salary in USD (37,731 to 139,465)

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Basic Statistics
- **Mean Experience:** 6.31 years
- **Mean Salary:** $83,945.60
- **Strong Correlation:** 0.98 between experience and salary

### Visualizations
1. **Scatter Plot:** Clear linear relationship between experience and salary
2. **Distribution Plots:**
   - Salary distribution (right-skewed)
   - Experience distribution (relatively uniform)
3. **Correlation Heatmap:** Very high positive correlation (0.98)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Preparation
- **Train-Test Split:** 80-20 split (28 training, 7 testing samples)
- **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler applied to normalize YearsExperience

### Model
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Training:** Simple linear regression on scaled features
- **Prediction:** Salary prediction based on years of experience

### Evaluation Metrics
Calculated on test set:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** To be calculated
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** To be calculated  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** To be calculated
- **R² Score:** To be calculated

## 🎯 Results

### Visualization
- Training data shown in orange
- Test data shown in blue
- Model predictions shown as black dashed line with markers
- Linear trend clearly visible, indicating good model fit

### Model Performance
The linear regression model successfully captures the relationship between experience and salary, with predictions closely following the actual data points.

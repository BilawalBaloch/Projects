# Email Classification Project

This project demonstrates a basic email classification system using a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. The goal is to classify emails as either 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'.

## Project Steps

The notebook (or script) follows these sequential steps to achieve email classification:

1.  **Data Loading**: The project begins by loading the email classification dataset from a CSV file (e.g., `email_classification_dataset.csv`).
2.  **Data Exploration**: Basic data exploration is performed to understand the dataset's structure. This includes:
    * Checking the total number of email samples.
    * Analyzing the distribution of labels (how many 'ham' vs. 'spam' emails).
3.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    * The categorical labels ('ham', 'spam') are converted into numerical values (e.g., 0 for 'ham' and 1 for 'spam') to be compatible with machine learning algorithms.
4.  **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. This allows the model to be trained on one subset of data and evaluated on unseen data, providing an unbiased assessment of its performance.
5.  **Text Vectorization**: The raw email text data is transformed into numerical features using `CountVectorizer`. This process converts the text into a matrix of token counts, which can then be used by the machine learning model.
6.  **Model Training**: A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is initialized and trained using the vectorized training data and their corresponding numerical labels.
7.  **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the trained model is assessed on the test set. A classification report is generated, which typically includes key metrics such as:
    * **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
    * **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
    * **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
    * **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of each class in the specified dataset.

## How to Run the Code

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```
2.  **Dataset**: Make sure the dataset CSV file (e.g., `email_classification_dataset.csv`) is in the same directory as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
3.  **Execute**: Run your Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
